# TeamManobal ‚Äì AI-Powered Mobile Platform for Democratizing Sports Talent Assessment

## üìå Problem Statement (SIH 25073)
**Title:** AI-Powered Mobile Platform for Democratizing Sports Talent Assessment

**Background:**  
Identifying and assessing athletic talent in India is challenging, especially for athletes from rural and remote areas. Standardized assessment tests (height, weight, vertical jump, shuttle run, sit-ups, endurance runs) provide scientific evaluation, but infrastructure constraints limit access.

**Problem Description:**  
The Sports Authority of India (SAI) requires a mobile-based platform to democratize sports talent assessment. The app should:  
- Allow athletes to record videos of prescribed fitness tests.  
- Use AI/ML-based on-device verification to analyze videos for accuracy (e.g., jump height, sit-ups count, run timing).  
- Securely submit verified data to SAI servers.  
- Be low-cost and lightweight for accessibility on entry-level smartphones and low-bandwidth networks.

**Innovative Features:**  
- AI-based Cheat Detection to identify tampered or incorrect movements.  
- Offline Video Analysis for preliminary performance assessment without internet.  
- Performance Benchmarking against age/gender norms with instant feedback.  
- Gamified UI with progress badges, leaderboards, and interactive visuals.  
- Auto-Test Segmentation for automatic detection of test clips (e.g., counting sit-ups).

**Expected Deliverables:**  
- Mobile app (Android/iOS) for video recording and assessment.  
- AI/ML modules for on-device video analysis and cheat detection.  
- Secure backend to transmit verified data to SAI.  
- Dashboard for officials to view and evaluate performance data.

**Expected Impact:**  
- Democratization of sports talent assessment in remote areas.  
- Low-cost, scalable solution enabling mass participation.  
- Improved efficiency and transparency in discovering athletes.
